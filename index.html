                <h3 class="skills--title">Retrieval Practice</h3>
                <p class="skill--text">The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.</p>

                <h3>Spaced Practice</h3>
                <p class="skill--text">This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Elaboration</h3>
                <p class="skill--text">Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>

                <h3>Interleaving</h3>

                <h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
                <p class="skill--text">It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>

            <div class="skills">
                <h3>Dual Coding</h3>
                <p class="skill--text">Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
